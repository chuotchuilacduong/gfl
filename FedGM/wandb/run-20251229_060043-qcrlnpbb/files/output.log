G:\conda\envs\gfl\Lib\site-packages\torch_geometric\data\in_memory_dataset.py:300: UserWarning: It is not recommended to directly access the internal storage format `data` of an 'InMemoryDataset'. If you are absolutely certain what you are doing, access the internal storage via `InMemoryDataset._data` instead to suppress this warning. Alternatively, you can access stacked individual attributes of every graph via `dataset.{attr_name}`.
